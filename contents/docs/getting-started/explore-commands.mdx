To ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards, use the following commands:

## Linting
**JavaScript Files:**
Run this command to lint your JavaScript files:
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```
**CSS/SASS Files:**
To lint your CSS or SASS files, execute:
  ```sh
  npm run lint:css
  ```
**PHP Code Standards:**
To check your PHP code for standard compliance, use:
  ```sh
  npm run phpcs
  ```
**Automatic PHP Fixes:**
For automatically fixing PHP code standard issues, run:
  ```sh
  npm run phpcbf
  ```
## Versioning

The `update-version.js` script checks for modifications in SCSS files and updates version numbers in related JSON and PHP files. Run the script manually if needed:
```sh
npm run updateVersion
```

#### Additional Notes
- The script uses a memory file (lastModifiedMemory.json) to store the last modification time. Ensure this file is writable.
- Each block should have a block.json, index.scss, and index.asset.php file for the script to work correctly.
